Nothing to see here. Just a post I can use to play with the formatting.

### A heading

Just checking to be sure that markdown does its thing.

~~~~perl
#GFM block
if (this_works()) {
   $mark_happy = 1;
}
~~~~

{%highlight perl linenos%}
#liquid block
if (this_works()) {
   $mark_happy = 1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
